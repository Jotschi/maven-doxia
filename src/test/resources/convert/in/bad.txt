  This document describes a format called <PTF> ({<<P>>oor <<T>>ext
  <<F>ormat}).

  PTF documents are:

      * Readable. The PTF reader use as few markup as possible to 
	recognize the structure of a document. Instead this reader 
	generally uses the <relative> indentation of paragraphs.

      * Easy to type using any text editor.

      * Easy to translate to real document formats such
	as LaTeX, troff, HTML or RTF.

  PTF is a good format for writing README files and C/C++ comments.
  With a tool such as docc you can automatically extract these
  comments from your source files and convert the extracted PTF chunks 
  into an acceptable reference manual.
