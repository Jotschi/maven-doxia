
Enhancements and bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* May, 2001
~~~~~~~~~~~

  <<APT format>>

      * Added support for numbered lists. List numbering schemes are : [[1]]
        (decimal), [[a]] (lower-aplha) , [[A]] (upper-alpha), [[i]]
        (lower-roman), [[I]] (upper-roman).

  <<RTF>>

      * New output format.

  <<HTML>>

      * The HTML converter nows supports 4 subtly different HTML variants:

          ** HTML as an ``SGML application'' using the transitional 4.0.1 DTD.
             (This is the default HTML variant.)

          ** HTML using the strict 4.0.1 DTD.
             (When <<-pi\ html\ strict\ yes>> is used.)

          ** XHTML 1.0 (HTML as an ``XML application'') using the strict DTD. 
             (When <<-pi\ html\ xml\ yes>> is used or simply when the 
              output file name ends with <<<.xhtml>>> or with <<<.xhtm>>>.)

          ** XHTML 1.0 using the transitional DTD.  
	     (When <<-pi\ html\ xml\ yes>> is used or when the output file 
              name ends with <<<.xhtml?>>> in conjunction with 
              <<-pi\ html\ strict\ no>>.)

      * Slightly improved rendering.

      * Generated HTML is much less (human) readable because I removed '\n'
        after some elements (ex. no '\n' after a \</p\>). (This extra
        whitespace used to disturb my XML editor.)

      * Bug fix: if a document contains an author element and if an author
        meta is specified as a command line option or in the .aptconvert file,
        two \<meta name="author"\> were added to the generated HTML pages.

  <<PS>>

      * Added <<-pi\ ps\ pass1>>\ <latex_to_dvi_command_template>.\
        Added <<-pi\ ps\ pass2>>\ <dvi_to_ps_command_template>.

  <<PDF>>

      * Added <<-pi\ pdf\ pass1>>\ <latex_to_dvi_command_template>.\
        Added <<-pi\ pdf\ pass2>>\ <dvi_to_ps_command_template>.\
        Added <<-pi\ pdf\ pass3>>\ <ps_to_pdf_command_template>.

        With these PIs it is now possible to use pdflatex or dvipdfm rather
        than dvips+ps2pdf to generate PDF.

  <<DocBook>>

      * Changed the generated tags to conform with Norman Walsh's
        {{{http://nwalsh.com/docbook/simple/index.html}Simplified DocBook XML
        DTD}} + \<anchor\>.

      * Gave up the support of DocBook V3 (i.e. no \<artheader\>, etc).

      * Renamed option publicID (resp. systemID) to publicId (resp. systemId).

      * Added <<-pi\ docbook\ css>>\ <file_name>.

* February 26, 2001
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      * <<-pi\ docbook\ publicID>> default is 
        <<<-//OASIS//DTD DocBook V4.1//EN>>>.

        In XML mode, <<-pi\ docbook\ publicID>> default is
        <<<-//OASIS//DTD DocBook XML V4.1.2//EN>>>.

        Validated the SGML and the XML generated by aptconvert using James
        Clark's {{{http://www.jclark.com/sp/index.htm}sp}}.

* June 17, 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      * Bug fix: when generating PostScript or PDF, LaTeX was not run enough
        times and the table of contents was sometimes wrong.

      * Removed the misplaced and redundant <<<standalone='no'>>> declaration
        in DocBook/XML. Validated the XML generated by aptconvert using a
        patched {{{http://xml.apache.org}Xerces-J}} 1.1.0 parser.

        Note that specifying <<-pi\ docbook\ systemID>>\ <URL>|<file> is
        required in order to generate valid DocBook/XML documents.

* June 13, 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      * Added support for DocBook/SGML (tested using
        {{{http://www.jclark.com/jade}James Clark's Jade}} and
        {{{http://www.nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl}Norman Walsh's Modular DocBook
        Stylesheets}}) and DocBook/XML (not really tested due to the lack of
        robust XML tools).

      * Enhanced aptconvert.bat to be able to pass it more than 9 arguments
        and to support the <<<TEMP>>> and <<<HOME>>> environment variables (if
        these are defined).

* April 5, 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      * When the construct <<\{\{\{>><name><<}>><text><<}}>> is used, the link
        text <text> may differ from the link name <name>.

      * Inside a link, text beginning with <<<http:/>>>, <<<https:/>>>,
        <<<ftp:/>>>, <<<file:/>>>, <<<mailto:>>>, <<<../>>>, <<<./>>>
        (<<<..\\>>> and <<<.\\>>> on Windows) is recognized as an external
        anchor name.

* February 28, 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      * Added <<-pi latex resizegraphics yes|no>>.

        If latex.resizegraphics is set to yes, graphics too large are
        automatically shrinked to accommodate the page size. Default: no.

      * Added support for the <<author>> meta to the LaTeX converter.

        If the document begins with a title block and if the author sub-block
        is not explicitely specified, an author sub-block is created from the
	value of the <<author>> meta, if any.

        Therefore it is possible to specify once for all that you are the
        author of all the documents your write by adding, for example, the
        following lines into your .aptconvertrc or aptconvert.ini:

+--+
author=Joe User\n\
juser@incredible-widgets.com
+--+

      * Aptconvert now runs latex in batchmode. Previously, errors found by
        latex caused aptconvert to block: latex was waiting for the user to
        type something.

	Latex is not supposed to find errors but this sometimes happens with
	special characters such as \\0 (in fact, the author intended to type
	<<<\\\\0>>>) or the ``power of two'' Latin-1 character (a bug in the
	inputenc package?).

      * The following encodings are now supported by the HTML converter:
        Cp1250, Cp1251, Cp1252, Cp1253.

* February 15, 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  First release.
