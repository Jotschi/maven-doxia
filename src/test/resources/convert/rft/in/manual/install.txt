
Installing aptconvert
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Install on Unix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Prerequisites:

      * Sun Java 1.1.7 or above.

      * If you need to convert APT documents to PostScript, a recent
        TeX distribution such as teTeX 0.9 or
        {{{http://www.miktex.de}MiKTeX}} 1.20e.

        TeX must support new option <<--interaction=>><mode> which is
        used to set TeX's interaction mode to batchmode.

	A number of non standard LaTeX packages such as <fancyhdr> are
	needed. See section about the {{LaTeX}} output format.

      * If you need to convert APT documents to PDF, the TeX distribution plus
        a recent Ghostscript distribution (such as 5.10) for its <<<ps2pdf>>>
        utility.

  Recommended software:

      * TYA 1.5+ ({{ftp://gonzalez.cyberus.ca/pub/Linux/java/}}), a JIT
        compiler for the Blackdown ports of Java for Linux.

      * ImageMagick (the program is called convert) converts an input file
        using one image format to an output file with the same or differing
        image format.

      * Xfig, a facility for interactive generation of figures under X11 and
        its companion, fig2dev, which translates Fig code to various graphics
        languages.

      * Gv, a PostScript and PDF previewer or Adobe Acrobat Reader, the
        ``official'' PDF previewer.

      * Ted, a WYSIWYG RTF editor.

  Procedure:

      [[1]] Unpack the APT distribution somewhere. This requires approximately
            1Mb of disk space.

---
$ cd 
$ gzip -d -c apt.tgz | tar xvf -
$ ls apt
class
distrib
java
makefile
---

            The binaries and the documentation are found in the distrib
            sub-directory. Class, java and makefile are only needed if you want
            to rebuild aptconvert.

      [[2]] Copy aptconvert and aptall.jar to a directory referenced in your
            path (example <<</usr/local/bin>>>).

---
$ su
$ cp ~/apt/distrib/aptconvert /usr/local/bin
$ cp ~/apt/distrib/aptall.jar /usr/local/bin
$ chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/aptconvert
$ chmod a+r /usr/local/bin/aptall.jar
---

      [[3]] You're done unless you want to provide a system-wide configuration
            to aptconvert users.

            In this case, 

	       [[a]] Use a text editor to create a file containing aptconvert
                     properties (more about this in the {{using aptconvert}}
                     section). For example, create a file called
                     <<</usr/local/lib/aptconvert.rc>>>.
           
	       [[b]] Use a text editor to modify last line of the script
	             <<</usr/local/bin/aptconvert>>>. Replace <<<jre>>> by
	             <<<jre -Daptconvertrc=/usr/local/bin/aptconvert.rc>>>.

* Install on Windows NT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Unfortunately, aptconvert doesn't work with the Microsoft JVM (aka jview),
  so you still need Sun Java.

  Install on Windows NT is similar to the install on Unix but under
  Windows you'll have to copy distrib\\aptconvert.bat rather than
  distrib/aptconvert.

  You'll also have to manually edit this .bat file and modify line:

---
set cp=D:\apt\distrib\aptall.jar
---

  by replacing <<<D:\apt\distrib\aptall.jar>>> by the actual name of
  the aptall.jar file.
